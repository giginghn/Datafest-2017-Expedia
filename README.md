# Datafest-2017-Expedia

In the Datafest 2017 competition - a celebration of data in which teams of undergraduates work within 48 hours to find and share meaning in a large, rich, and complex dataset, I worked in the team of 4 UCI students to extract meaningful findings in the Expedia data on flights and hotel booking. 

## Cleaning data
